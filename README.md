# Week-3
 Implementing Hyperparameter Tunning

Hyperparameter Tunning is very important part in machine learning trip, which you more fit your model to gave you the best as possible

This is an example to practice your knowledge of Hyperparameter Tunning methods with one of the famouse supervised learning tools

scikit-learn : is one of the simple, effective, and powerfull kits to practice your machine learning with it

Try this example as a start point to test your knowledge,

Iportant note: This example is developed by Udacity coarse coach of the nanodegree program of machine learning, if you will re-puplish it, please don't forget to add this note also

Start your learning trip :)
